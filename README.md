# Azure DevOps Utilities
This repository contains utility scripts to run/configure DevOp systems in Azure. These scripts can be used individually, but are also leveraged in several 'Getting Started' solutions:
* [Jenkins Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?term=Jenkins)
* [Spinnaker Quickstart Templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/?term=Spinnaker)
