## Create Service Principal

Creates Azure Service Principal credentials.

Requires that the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/xplat-cli-install) is pre-installed.

The script prompts for user input to be able to authenticate on Azure and to pick the desired subscription (this step can be skipped by providing the subscription id as a script argument).

For doing this in Windows without a bash shell, refer to instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal-cli)

Another alternative using PowerShell can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-authenticate-service-principal)
